#    assert_raises() adds two optional arguments: "exc_args"
#    and "exc_pattern". "exc_args" is a tuple that is expected
#    to match the .args attribute of the raised exception.
#    "exc_pattern" is a compiled regular expression that the
#    stringified raised exception is expected to match.

#
# Usage: assert_raises(ExceptionType, method_to_execute,
#                       arguments_to_method, kwargs_to_method,
#                       exc_pattern=r'^.+$')
# Please note that exc_pattern is not required, but if passed
# matches the exception message.
#
# Fail Conditions
# Fails on exception not raised, wrong exception type or
# invalid exception message.
